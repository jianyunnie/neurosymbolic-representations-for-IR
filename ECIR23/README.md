## Presenters



**Laura Dietz, Associate Professor, University
of New Hampshire (main contact).**

Dr. Dietz focuses on integrating relevant-oriented tasks, using full-text search,  Wikipedia knowledge, and fine-grained semantic annotations, along with subtopic extraction, content organization, and natural language generation. She organized the KG4IR Tutorial and Workshop Series (ICTIR 2016, WSDM 2017, SIGIR 2017, SIGIR 2018) and the TREC Complex Answer Retrieval track (2017--2019).


**Hannah Bast, Full Professor, University of Freiburg.**

Dr. Bast is interested in all aspects of information retrieval, with a focus on efficiency, ease of use, and fully functional systems. Her search systems power DBLP, Google Maps, and maybe soon Wikidata.  Her work combines indexing and search in full text and structured knowledge for downstream applications such as question answering.



**Shubham Chatterjee, Research Associate, University of Glasgow.**

Dr. Chatterjee focuses on neural entity-oriented information retrieval and extraction, particularly text understanding using entities and entity ranking. 
His goal is to build an intelligent search system that can answer open-ended information needs.


**Jeff Dalton, Senior Lecturer, University of Glasgow.**

Dr. Dalton focuses on methods for effectively leveraging knowledge for complex information-seeking tasks. His work on entity-based query feature expansion published at SIGIR in 2014 is one of the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of using general-purpose knowledge graphs for search.

He is a Turing AI Acceleration Fellow at the Turing Institute with a prestigious UKRI fellowship, and the lead organizer of the TREC Conversational Assistance track.



**Edgar Meij, Head of Search and Discovery, Bloomberg AI.**

Dr. Meij leads several teams of researchers and engineers that work on information retrieval, semantic parsing, question answering, and smart contextual suggestions under severe latency constraints. Together, these researchers and engineers build, maintain, and leverage the companyâ€™s search, autocomplete, and question-answering systems. 

He has taught several tutorials and organized various workshops on knowledge graphs, entity linking, and semantic search at top-tier conferences.

**Arjen de Vries, Full Professor, Radboud University.**

Dr. de Vries uses structured and unstructured information to improve information access. He works on entity linking as well as entity retrieval, demonstrating that having knowledge of the entities in the query can help improve retrieval performance for entity-oriented search tasks.

Dr. de Vries organized the first information retrieval evaluation campaigns that looked beyond documents into entities---the Enterprise Search track at TREC and later, the Entity Ranking track at INEX. He also organized the tutorial _From Expert Finding to Entity Search on the Web_ at ECIR 2012.
